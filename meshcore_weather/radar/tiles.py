"""Cutting the tile a phone asked for out of a radar picture (spec 7D).

A tile is 32 x 32 cells over a square of the earth on a fixed lattice
(`v5.radar_tile`).  A cell's level is the strongest echo in it, not the
average: a thunderstorm core is smaller than a cell, and averaging it away is
the one thing a radar picture on a phone must not do.
