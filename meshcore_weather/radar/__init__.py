"""Radar tiles cut from the Weather Service mosaics the dish receives.

EMWIN carries a national radar picture and fourteen regional ones as GIFs, a
new one of each every 15 minutes.  `picture` turns one into precipitation
levels, `tiles` cuts the 32 x 32 tile a phone asked for out of it, and
`source` finds the newest picture on disk.  Spec section 7D (revision 11).

Nothing here runs until somebody asks: a request decodes one GIF, which is
cached until a newer one arrives.
