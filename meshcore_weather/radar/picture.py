"""One EMWIN radar GIF, as precipitation levels.

The pictures are drawn for people: a banner, a map with roads and county
lines over it, warning polygons, a colour scale, and the time in the corner.
Everything here is about reading that back as numbers without being fooled by
the drawing.

- **dBZ.**  The GIF palette is rebuilt for every picture, so no colour table
  can be shipped.  The picture carries its own: the scale along the bottom,
  -30 dBZ at x = 36 and 2.38 px per dBZ.  The 256 palette entries are
  classified once against it and the image is mapped through the result.
- **Furniture.**  Roads, borders and labels sit in the same pixels of every
  picture, so a mask per product (`scripts/radar_calibrate.py`) removes them.
  It matters: the roads are drawn in the scale's own 58 dBZ red.
- **Warning polygons** are drawn in colours the scale also uses, but their
  strokes are edged in black.  A black pixel the mask does not explain is a
  polygon edge; grown three pixels it covers the stroke.  The echo under a
  stroke is lost, which is acceptable: the app draws the polygon itself.
- **Time.**  The valid time is printed in the corner and nowhere else.  The
  ten digits are always drawn the same way, so they are matched against
  stored shapes.  It is worth the trouble: a picture is anywhere from 2 to 34
  minutes old when the dish receives it, and the file name cannot say which.

Masked pixels are -1, "cannot tell", and the tile cutter fills them from their
neighbours.  Pixels are never guessed dry.
