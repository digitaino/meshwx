"""The newest radar picture of each product, from the dish's EMWIN directory.

goesproc writes radar GIFs next to the text products, under
`<dir>/YYYY-MM-DD/`, named `Z_<wmo>_C_KWIN_<received>_<seq>-3-<PRODUCT>.GIF`.
Nothing is decoded until a request needs it. Decoded pictures are kept, the
most recently used first, so a loop (spec 7D.4) asked for twice does not decode
its hour twice.
