"""How long each product type stays in the store.

The store used to drop everything after 12 hours. A heat advisory issued at
10 PM for the next afternoon is still in force at noon, so it vanished from
the answers while NWS still had it up (found 2026-09-14 against
api.weather.gov: 4 of 9 Texas heat advisories missing). Warning-class
products now live long enough for their VTEC expiry to be the thing that
retires them; storm reports long enough to filter by report time.
