"""The internet fill: the bot's one backup, with one rule.

The feed is the dish (SDRSource), or NOAA's EMWIN bundles on a bot without
one (InternetSource). A product the feed has not delivered within a grace of
being issued, 2 minutes for a warning and 15 for anything else
(`fill_grace_warning_min`, `fill_grace_min`), is taken from NWS over the
internet instead:

- **Text products** (forecasts, discussions, warnings, watches, statements,
  climate and river products) from api.weather.gov, which lists every NWS
  text product within about a minute of issue. One listing a minute of the
  types the bot reads (FILL_TYPES) says what was issued; the text of a
  product is fetched only once its grace is up and the feed still has not
  brought it. Matched by WMO heading, office and minute (`key`): over
  06:00-06:30Z on 2026-10-19 the API listed every product of those types the
  dish received, and the dish's copies all matched by that key.
- **Airport reports and forecasts** from NWS's own feeds on tgftp (DS.metar,
  DS.tafst): a file every five minutes with every report. The API has
  neither. Each file is read once its grace is up, and of the reports in it
  for stations the bot knows (its station table), those whose station has
  nothing as new from the feed (or from the fill already) are taken, as one
  product. Decided report by report, by station and time: on 2026-10-19 the
  dish's bundles came anywhere from 3 minutes to 3 hours late, and one fresh
  bundle had said every station was current, so KAUS 1553Z never came. A
  file counts as filling in only when the feed missed most of what it
  carries of it; stations EMWIN does not carry at all (some 200 of the
  table's, military fields mostly) are taken but never count.
- **Radar** from radar.weather.gov's standard mosaics: the pictures EMWIN
  carries, same size and same base map (94% of pixels the same between a dish
  frame and a web frame two hours apart, the rest echoes and the time). While
  a region's newest picture on the feed is older than `fill_radar_grace_min`,
  the web's newest is taken every five minutes. The radar reader times each
  picture from its own printed corner, as for the dish's.

Why one rule (2026-10-19): there were two backups. The dish's took NOAA's
internet bundles after 10 minutes of silence, but those are the uplink's own
queue, as late as the dish when NOAA fell behind on Oct 17-18; and NWS's METAR
feed came on when EMWIN ran 30 minutes late, for current conditions only,
while forecasts and warnings still came hours late. This covers both: a
silent dish means nothing arrives and everything is filled after its grace; a
late uplink means only what is late is filled.

The fill takes nothing the feed brought in time, so a bot whose dish works
uses the internet for one listing a minute and for whatever the dish dropped.
A product the feed delivers after the fill took it is a duplicate, and the
source drops it (`filled`); its arrival still counts towards how late the
uplink runs. Filled products say "internet" (spec 2.3, revision 7).
