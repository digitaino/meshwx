"""Broadcast scheduler: when each job runs, and the one place that puts
v5 messages on the data channel (the app responder sends through it too,
so the sequence counter and the spacing are shared).

Each tick: reload the config if the portal changed it, run the jobs that
are due, send what they built with a gap between packets, keep per-job
stats. Warning state (what was sent, with which fingerprint), the next
header seq, when each job last ran and when the node last adverted are
persisted, so a restart neither re-sends every active warning as new, nor
jumps the sequence apps track, nor puts the digest, observations, forecast,
coverage statement and an advert on the air again just because the
process started.

Two more guards for a bot nobody is watching:

- a ceiling on scheduled packets per hour, every job together
  (MCW_SCHEDULED_PACKETS_PER_HOUR). Life-safety warnings and their repeat
  always go and count; past it the other jobs wait (WARNING once an hour,
  and a row on the portal's limits card);
- a per-bot jitter, from the node's public key, on when each periodic job
  first runs after a start, so two bots that boot together do not stay in
  lock-step.
