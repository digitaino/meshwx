"""The debug bridge: the iOS app as a client of this bot, with no radio.

Three things a development client needs and a radio would otherwise give
it: the datagrams this bot transmits (`/bridge/stream`, `/bridge/datagrams`),
a way to ask for one (`/bridge/request`, which runs the *same*
`AppResponder.handle_request` a DM does — same per-sender spacing, same
hourly budget, answer on the air), and who it is talking to
(`/bridge/info`).

Off unless the portal is enabled AND `MCW_BRIDGE_TOKEN` is set; every call
carries the token in `X-Bridge-Token` (or `Authorization: Bearer`). State
changes also need the portal's `X-Requested-With: meshcore-portal` header,
like every other POST. Bind the portal to 127.0.0.1 and reach it over an
SSH tunnel: nothing here is meant to face a network.
