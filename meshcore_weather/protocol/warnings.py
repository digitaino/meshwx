"""Extract active warnings from the EMWIN store using pyIEM (canonical NWS parser).

pyIEM (Iowa Environmental Mesonet) is the reference Python implementation for
parsing NWS text products. It handles VTEC (NWSI 10-1703), UGC (NWSI 10-1702),
polygon extraction with correct winding, both Z (zone) and C (county FIPS)
codes, and non-VTEC products like SPS via UGC-line expiry.

We build the UGCProvider from our bundled `geodata/zones.json` at module init
so the parser runs fully offline with no database or network dependency.

Each warning dict carries an `expires_at` (tz-aware datetime). That's the
NWS-authoritative expiry — the source of truth. `expiry_minutes` is a
convenience value (minutes from *now*) recomputed at extraction time.

A hand-rolled fallback path is retained for the edge case where pyIEM cannot
parse a product.
