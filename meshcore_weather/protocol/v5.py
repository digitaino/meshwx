"""MeshWX v5 wire codec — reference encoder and decoder.

This module is the normative implementation of ``docs/MeshWX_v5_Spec.md``.
It is deliberately dependency-free (standard library only, nothing from
``meshcore_weather``) so that an app developer can read it top to bottom and
port it to Swift, Kotlin or C without chasing imports.

Every v5 message is the ``data`` field of one MeshCore ``GRP_DATA`` packet on
the ``#meshwx`` channel with ``data_type = 0xFF10``.  ``data`` is at most 165
bytes and every message fits in one packet; only Text carries chunk numbers.

Every type but one travels bot -> app.  Request (type 9, spec 7B, new in
revision 6) is the app's `>` request flooded on the same channel: the bot
decodes it and never sends one.

Layout of the 4-byte common header::

    offset 0  u8   seq    per-bot sequence number, wraps 255 -> 0
    offset 1  u16  bot    first two bytes of the bot's public key, LE
    offset 3  u8   type   high nibble = message type, low nibble = flags

Since revision 7 bits 2-3 of the flags nibble are the same field in every
type but Cancel: the data source (``SOURCE_*``), where the weather in this
message came from.  Cancel spends its whole nibble on a reason code and is
the one exception.

All multi-byte integers are little-endian.  Times are Unix minutes
(``seconds // 60``) as u32.
