// The Radar section of a place page (revision 11 §3), under the forecast.
//
// Three states and no fourth, which is `WeatherRadarCard`'s own shape:
//
//   *nothing held*  "No radar picture yet." and the ask
//   *held*          a square, still map of the tile, the summary, the time, and the ask again
//   *no coordinate* no section at all — not an empty one, absent
//
// The whole picture is one button that opens the radar screen. A card whose only content is a
// map looks tappable and does nothing unless the button itself has the hit area
// (docs/MESHWX_UI.md §3.1 U-32), so the map inside takes no gestures of its own: `interactive:
// false`, and the tile is framed rather than freely pannable.
//
// **This is the one ask on a place page.** Everything else there is Update's (§11.1), and radar
// is not Update's: a picture is one packet, it is never asked for on a schedule (revision 11 §4),
// and a tile nobody asked for is a tile the channel never carried.
