// Port of MC1/Views/Tools/Weather/WeatherAreaMapView.swift.
//
// The alert map (docs/MESHWX_UI.md §17): every area the radio says is under an alert, shaded by
// event. Revision 10 dropped "National" from its name, because a map is no longer necessarily of
// the country:
//
//   *"Can we go from national alert map to just alert map, and have a way for the user to select
//   which areas they want to request the warnings for. One, a few, or all. That way we don't
//   default to sending everything."* (owner, 20 September 2026)
//
// **This screen never asks for anything on its own.** No request on appear, none on a pull, none
// on a timer — one sweep is up to eight packets broadcast to everyone on `#meshwx`, and a screen
// that fetched one because it was opened would spend the whole channel's airtime on a swipe. The
// only thing that sends is a tap on a button, and the button says what the tap costs before it is
// spent.
//
// What it shows is a **picture**, not a sweep: a phone can hold last hour's country and this
// minute's Texas at once and both are true, so `WeatherAlertMapPicture` resolves them into one
// map and one status line per part (`model.alertMapPicture`). Areas of states outside every held
// scope are simply not drawn — never implied clear, which is what the "not asked for" line under
// a scoped map is there to say.
