// The radar screen (revision 11 §3, revision 13 §3), pushed from the place page's Radar card.
//
// One map, framed on the tile, and everything the picture says about the place under it: the
// legend, the time, the summary, and a control that picks the width — Local, Regional, Wide, the
// same three words the traffic log uses, never kilometres (a tile is two degrees, which is 222 km
// tall everywhere and a different width at every latitude).
//
// Two rules the drawing follows and the alert map does not:
//
// - **The alerts are outlines here.** This device may be holding a Flood Warning over the same
//   ground, and a filled polygon over the cells would hide the very thing the screen is for. The
//   shapes go on unfilled, above the cells, so both can be read at once.
// - **Unknown cells are hatched, never left looking dry.** Outside a partial tile's bounds there
//   is no reading at all, and the line under the map says so in words as well.
//
// Revision 13 adds **the last hour**, asked for and never done by itself. Under the map, for
// whatever width is on screen: Play / Pause once the loop has two frames, "Ask for the last hour"
// while it has fewer than five, and a line when a picture is missing. Nothing plays by itself;
// leaving the screen or changing width stops it. Each frame's drawing is built once and the map
// steps through them without re-framing.
//
// It is bound to the page it was opened from (docs/MESHWX_UI.md §3.1 U-18): the place, the tiles
// and the bot all come from that page's snapshot, and never from whichever page the pager has
// since landed on.
