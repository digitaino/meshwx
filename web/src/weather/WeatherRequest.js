 * The MeshWX v5 request grammar (spec §8.2), one case per line of the table, with the text
 * the bot parses and the answer the app should wait for.
 *
 * Requests are plain text starting with `>`. The bot takes them as a DM or as text on
 * `#meshwx`; the app sends a DM, which only the addressed bot can read, so exactly one bot
 * answers (spec §8.2, §12, revision 2). The same words without the prefix are what people type
 * in the bot's chat and get a text reply for; the prefix is what turns the answer into v5
 * messages on `#meshwx` for every listening app. Identities and codes are carried as the
 * strings the bot expects (`SV.W.EWX.42`, `TXC453`, `KAUS`, `EWX`); the caller renders them
 * from the bundle tables, so this type stays free of the wire tables and of anything the UI
 * would have to localise.
 *
 * A Swift enum with associated values is `{ kind, …labels }` (PORTING.md §3). The constant
 * cases are frozen values on this namespace, the rest are builders.
