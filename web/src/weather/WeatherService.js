/**
 * What the weather service needs from a radio: channel datagrams in both directions, a DM going
 * out, and a way to tell which slot is `#meshwx`. Narrow on purpose so tests can drive the
 * service with a fake. Duck-typed — `src/link/` holds the implementations:
 *
 *   subscribeDatagrams(fn) -> unsubscribe
 *       `fn` receives a `ChannelDatagram`: `{ channelIndex, pathLength, dataType, data, snr }`,
 *       `data` a `Uint8Array`. Replaces the Swift `datagramEvents()` stream; every event kind
 *       other than a channel datagram is the transport's to filter out.
 *   subscribeAcknowledgements(fn) -> unsubscribe
 *       `fn` receives one delivery-confirmation code as a `Uint8Array`: the recipient's radio
 *       received a DM this radio sent.
 *   async sendRequest({ to, text, timestamp, attempt }) -> Uint8Array
 *       A plain-text DM to a public key with `timestamp` (ms) and `attempt` on the wire as
 *       given, returning the ACK code the radio expects back for this transmission. A resend
 *       passes the first send's timestamp with the next attempt.
 *   async sendChannelRequest({ text, botID, timestamp, seq })
 *       -> { channelIndex, dataType, data } | void
 *       The same `>` text as a Request datagram, flooded on `#meshwx` (spec §7B). Nothing comes
 *       back from the air: a datagram has no acknowledgement — the answer on the channel is the
 *       acknowledgement. A transport that builds the datagram itself returns it, so the traffic
 *       log holds the bytes that actually went out; one that only forwards the text (the bridge,
 *       the replay) returns nothing and the service encodes the Request it stands for. Throws
 *       `WeatherTransportError` with kind `channelRequestsUnavailable` when this radio cannot
 *       send one at all, which is the service's cue to fall back to the DM ladder.
 *   async resetPath({ to })
 *       Forgets the route the radio holds to a public key, so the next DM goes out by flood.
 *   async channelSecret({ at }) -> Uint8Array | null
 *       The 16-byte secret of a channel slot, or null when it cannot be read.
 *   async isDrainingBacklog() -> boolean
 *       Whether the radio's message queue is being drained right now. A datagram delivered
 *       meanwhile is backlog: it can be hours old, and it says nothing about whether the bot is
 *       in range now.
 *   async linkState() -> WeatherTransportLink | null
 *       The link this transport provides of its own, or null — which is the answer over a radio.

// MARK: - Service

/**
 * Listens to the MeshWX weather bots on `#meshwx`, keeps one `WeatherBotState` per bot, and
 * sends the app's `>` requests with the spec's etiquette (docs/MESHWX.md, spec §13).
 *
 * Per connection, like every service in the container — the datagram stream belongs to the
 * session — but the *state* is not: it is loaded from and saved to a store shared across
 * connections, because a warning belongs to a place, not to the radio that heard it.
 *
 * Observers use `subscribe(fn) -> unsubscribe` (PORTING.md §3); `fn` is called with a
 * `WeatherEvent`. Registration is synchronous, so nothing yielded after the call is dropped.
 *
 * Deviations from the Swift:
 *
 * - Swift's `ingest` is overloaded on datagram and message. JS has no overloads, so the datagram
 *   one is `ingestDatagram`; `ingest` keeps the message, which is the one tests and previews
 *   feed traffic through.
 * - Durations are `TimeInterval` seconds, not `Duration` (PORTING.md §3). The scheduler is
 *   injected and takes milliseconds, like `setTimeout`.
 * - The actor is a promise queue: `ingest`, `send`, `clearState` and the retry timer are
 *   serialised, so no two of them interleave. `acknowledge` is not — it takes no `await`, and in
 *   Swift it reaches the actor while a send is suspended, which is what makes a confirmation
 *   that lands before the send returns count.
