// Deviation from the Swift: Swift takes `state` `inout` and returns the changes. JS reducers stay
// pure (PORTING.md §3), so every entry point here returns the new state:

//   apply(message, { to, receivedAt })            -> { state, changes }
//   pruneExpired(state, { expiredBefore })        -> { state, expired }
//   prunePendingUpgrades(state, { olderThan })    -> state
//   pruneTexts(state, { receivedBefore, limit })  -> state
//   pruneForecasts(state, { receivedBefore, limit }) -> state
//
// The message is the decoded wire object (PORTING.md §5): `message.seq`, `message.bot`,
// `message.type`, `message.flags`, `message.name` for the payload kind, `message.source` for the
// header's data source, and the payload's own fields flat on the same object.
