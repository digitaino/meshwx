 *   no route to go stale, and no acknowledgement either — the answer is the acknowledgement.
 * - `dm`: a DM to the bot's public key, the ladder of spec §8.2. The fallback, for a radio that

 *
 * `{ id, request, botID, botPublicKey, sentAt, transportKind, attempt, timestamp, seq,
 *    ackCodes, botRadioReceived }`
 *
 * - `sentAt`, `timestamp`: milliseconds (PORTING.md §3).
 * - `attempt`: 0 for the first transmission, 1 for the one retry spec §8.2 allows; on the DM
 *   ladder 2 is the flood after the route is forgotten. A channel request never goes past 1
 *   (spec §7B: send once, once more after 10 s, never a third time).
 * - `timestamp`: the timestamp on the wire, the same for every transmission: with attempt 0 then
 *   1 the retry is one message sent again to the bot's radio, and the same request to the bot. A
 *   Request datagram carries it as its `ts`, which is exactly what makes a resend a copy.
 * - `seq`: the sender's own sequence number, on a channel request only (spec §7B), repeated on
 *   the resend. 0 and meaningless for a DM.
 * - `ackCodes`: the ACK codes the radio expects back, one per transmission, each a lower-case
 *   hex string of the `Uint8Array` the transport returned. Empty for a channel request: a
 *   datagram has no acknowledgement. (Swift holds a `Set<Data>`; PORTING.md §3 makes a persisted
 *   or boundary-crossing set an array of strings, and hex is how `Data` reads.)
 * - `botRadioReceived`: the radio confirmed (an ACK for either transmission) that the bot's radio
 *   received the request. Says nothing about the answer, and never true for a channel request.
