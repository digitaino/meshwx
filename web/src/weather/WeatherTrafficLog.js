// Port of MC1Services/Services/Weather/Screen/WeatherTrafficLog.swift (docs/PORTING.md).
//
// Deviation from the Swift's directory: the Swift keeps `WeatherTrafficEntry` and
// `WeatherTrafficLog` beside the screen rules, where `MC1Services` is one module and the service
// can reach them. The web client's layers are one-way — `weather` never imports `screen`
// (PORTING.md §9) — and `WeatherService` is what writes every row, so the entry and the log live
// here. `WeatherTrafficSummary`, which needs the tables and the string table to word a row, is a
// screen rule and stays in `src/screen/`.
//
// Owner, 20 September 2026: *"A way to see all the GRP_DATA traffic on a channel like we do a
// chat."* That is what this is: a plain record of what went past on `#meshwx`, kept because the
// alternative was reading a console log over somebody's shoulder.

/**
 * One datagram on the weather channel, in or out (docs/MESHWX_UI.md §17):
 *
 * `{ id, at, direction, isBacklog, channelIndex, dataType, botID, seq, type, flags, length,
 * snr, pathLength, hex, isDuplicate }`
 *
 * Everything the header said is kept *as read*, and the whole payload as hex, because the point
 * of the screen is the traffic and not this app's opinion of it: a datagram the codec could not
 * read is exactly the one worth being able to look at. The header fields are null for such a
 * one, and for a datagram of another `data_type` that happened to be on the slot.
 *
 * - `direction`: `'received'` for anything the radio delivered, `'sent'` for a Request datagram
 *   this device put on the air. A DM is not here: it is not a datagram and nobody else saw it.
 * - `isBacklog`: drained from the radio's queue at connect rather than heard live. It can be
 *   hours old and says nothing about whether the bot is in range now.
 * - `isDuplicate`: the reducer recognised it as a copy of a message already applied — the bot's
 *   own "nobody echoed me" retransmission (spec §2.3). Kept rather than hidden: a channel full
 *   of repeats is the thing a person opens this screen to find out.
 * - `snr`, `pathLength`: what the radio reported, when it reported anything.

 * Persisted through the same injected key-value storage the weather state uses, under its own
 * key: it is a cache of what went past, and like the state it is written best-effort — a blob
 * that cannot be read or written leaves the visit working and nothing kept.
