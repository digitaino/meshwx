 * Whether the screen offers to ask for the packets of an answer that never arrived, and which
 * request that tap would send (spec §7C, revision 10).
 *
 * Owner, 20 September 2026: *"'4 of 7 parts arrived': should allow me to re-request the missing
 * data."* An **offer**, never automatic — a resend costs one packet of shared airtime per part,
 * and a screen that fetched them because it was opened would spend the channel on a swipe.
 *
 * Two times bound the offer, and each of them is a different mistake being avoided:
 *
 * - **At least 15 s since the newest packet.** The bot resends a packet nothing echoed, 8-10 s
 *   later, of its own accord. Offering before that has had its chance asks for a packet that is
 *   already on the air.
 * - **At most 10 minutes since the first packet.** `PARTS_CACHE_S` is 600: past it the bot no
 *   longer holds the bytes, and `>part` would come back Not available. After that the ordinary
 *   ask — the whole map, the whole report — is the only offer there is.
