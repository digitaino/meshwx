 * of the place and not stale.
 *
 * Past that, up to `labelledReadingKilometres`, a fresh reading is still shown, **attributed to
 * its station** — "Nearest report: San Marcos, 26 km away" — rather than passed off as the town's
 * (owner decision 2026-09-18, docs/MESHWX_UI.md §3.1 U-2a). Wimberley's nearest station is 25.5 km
 * off: under a hard 25 km cliff its page asked, the answer arrived, and the page threw it away.
 * Further than that, or three hours old, a reading answers a different question and the page shows
 * the ask instead, naming the station a refresh would spend airtime on — or, when no station is
 * close enough for its answer to be shown, says so and asks for nothing.
 *
 * `WeatherUpdatePlan` reads its readings step **off this verdict**, so the sentence on the page and
 * the packet on the air are always the same station. They used to be worked out twice, and the two
 * drifted: the page offered to ask about a station while Update called it current.
