// MARK: - What was posted

/**
 * One notification this phone has posted: the warning it stands for, the place it was posted for,
 * and what the user was last told about it.
 *
 * `{ identifier, identity, placeID, botID, tornado, floodDamage, expiresMinutes, coversPlace,
 * postedAt, alertedAt, alertedExpiresMinutes }`.
 *
 * Kept between launches. A repeat of a warning must replace its notification silently rather than
 * sound again, and the phone can be relaunched between the two (docs/MESHWX_UI.md §16).
 *
 * - `botID`: the bot whose copy was posted first. A second bot holding the same warning updates
 *   this notification rather than posting a second one.
 * - `coversPlace`: whether the warning covered the place, as against being near it.
 * - `alertedAt` / `alertedExpiresMinutes`: the last post the user could hear, and the expiry it
 *   named. An extension sounds again only once it is 20 minutes past this, and only against the
 *   time the user was actually told.
