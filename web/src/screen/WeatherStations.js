 * - `direction` is from the place towards the station.
 * - `isInFootprint`: the station has been in one of a bot's scheduled batches in the last day, so
 *   it is in that bot's area, whoever's request delivered the reading held now.
 * - `isInLatestBatch`: the station is in the newest scheduled batch its bot has sent, so a bare
 *   `>o` would come back carrying it. One the bot has since dropped from its batch stays in the
 *   footprint for a day but can only be refreshed by `>o <ICAO>` (docs/MESHWX_UI.md §8, §11).
