   * - **A few states**: `ceil((entries in those states + states) / 38)`, at least 1. The scope
   *   entries count toward the 38 an entry budget holds (spec §7C), which is why the state count
   *   is in the numerator — fifteen states cost almost half a packet before any weather does.
   * - **A few states with nothing national held**: one packet per four states, at least one.
   *
   * The entry count is read from the whole picture rather than from the national part alone.
   * The picture is by construction the newest word on every state (`WeatherAlertMapPicture`), so
   * for a selection it is a better estimate of what a fresh sweep would carry than the national
   * sweep on its own — and where no scoped sweep has ever arrived the two are the same number.
   *
   * `held` is a `WeatherAlertMapPicture`; `tables` names the scope's state indices, exactly as
   * everywhere else in this layer.
