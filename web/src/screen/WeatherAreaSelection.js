// Port of MC1Services/Sources/MC1Services/Services/Weather/Screen/WeatherAreaSelection.swift

// Owner, 20 September 2026: *"Can we go from national alert map to just alert map, and have a way
// for the user to select which areas they want to request the warnings for. One, a few, or all.
// That way we don't default to sending everything."*
//
// So the selection is a thing the device *holds*, not a thing a screen builds each time it opens:
// it is answering "which part of the country am I looking at", and that outlives a visit.

/**
 * How a set of states is named, wherever one is: "Texas", "Texas and Oklahoma", "Texas, Oklahoma
 * and New Mexico", "6 states".
 *
 * The design writes both joins out ("Texas, Oklahoma · as of 13:40" and "Ask for Texas and
 * Oklahoma"), so the comma folds every pair but the last and the last takes the word. Past
 * `maxNamed` the count is the fact and the names are a wall.
 *
 * Swift keeps this on `WeatherAreaMapCopy` (MC1/Views/Tools/Weather/WeatherAreaMapView.swift),
 * beside the screen it was written for, and `WeatherTrafficCopy` calls across to it. Here the
 * traffic log's words are built in `src/screen` and may not reach into `src/ui` or `src/app`
 * (docs/PORTING.md §9), so the rule itself lives in the pure layer and the *names* are handed to
 * it: `WeatherReferenceNames.stateList` is the one that turns codes into them.
