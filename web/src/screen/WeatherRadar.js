//
// Pure, as everything in this layer is: no clock of its own, no words, no colours. `now` is
// always a parameter, distances come back in kilometres for the caller to convert to the
// device's units, and a level is the wire's number — the three colours and the three names are
// the view's.
//
// One rule runs through all of it: **a cell outside a partial tile's bounds is unknown, not
// dry.** The wire has four levels and no fifth, so an uncovered cell is level 0 like a clear
// one, and every reader here goes through `MeshWXRadar.isKnown` before it believes a zero.
