/**
 * Whether a place is in a bot's area, and from what evidence:

 *
 * First the bot's own statement (Coverage, spec §7A): its circle and the zones it lists. That is
 * the only thing that describes coverage, and the reason the message exists — guessing from the
 * hourly stations and from the offices of whatever warnings were active told a real phone that
 * WX-AUS "may not carry alerts for Travis County", the bot's own home county (§3.1 I-B18).
 *
 * Failing a statement, the footprint the bot has demonstrated: the stations in its scheduled
 * batches (docs/MESHWX_UI.md §6). A batch of one station is the answer to somebody's
 * single-station request — a `>o KJFK` would otherwise put Manhattan "in coverage" — so only
 * multi-station batches count, and only from the last 24 hours on the bot's clock.
 *
 * A place is in that footprint when it is inside the convex hull of the bot's stations, or within
 * `stationReachKilometres` of one of them. The bot relays alerts for about 120 km around its home
 * but reports only the nearest reporting stations inside that circle, the farthest about 96 km out
 * for WX-AUS. A fixed reach around every station therefore ran well past the alert area. The hull
 * stays inside the area: a place between its edge and the area's is called out of coverage, which
 * is the side to err on.
 *
 * Either way, "outside" needs evidence.
