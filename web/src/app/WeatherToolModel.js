/**
 * The Weather tool's model: gathers the inputs, builds one `WeatherScreenSnapshot` **per page**
 * on defined triggers, and holds what the service does not — the place, request outcomes, and the
 * transient notices.
 *
 * ## Observing it
 *
 * `model.subscribe(fn) → unsubscribe`, fired at most once per animation frame (per microtask
 * under Node) whenever anything a screen can read has changed. That is the port of `@Observable`:
 * every property below is a plain property, read through the model, and every path that changes
 * one ends in the notify.
 *
 * ## Deviations from the Swift (docs/PORTING.md)
 *
 * - `AppState` is `WeatherHost`, one documented interface. `attach`, `appear`,
 *   `scenePhaseChanged`, `contactsChanged`, `channelSyncChanged`, `locationSampleChanged` and
 *   `authorizationChanged` are all still here, and the host's one `subscribe` calls them.
 * - The web's `WeatherService` exists from boot, connected or not, so the Swift's second path —
 *   reading the state file with no services — is gone, and with it `cachedOfflineStates` and
 *   `clearReceivedWeather`'s file branch.
 * - `WeatherPreferenceStore` was not in the port: the chosen bot is one value under
 *   `weather.preferredBotID` in the same synchronous defaults the other stores use.
 * - `Calendar`/`Locale` are `timeZone` (an IANA id) and `locale`, injected.
 * - The accessibility announcement is not `AccessibilityNotification`: a settled request sets
 *   `announcement`, which a screen renders into an `aria-live` region (PORTING §7 — the rule is
 *   ported, the iOS mechanism is not).
 * - Every timer is injected and cancellable, and `stop()` clears all of them.
