//
// Radar (type 11, spec §7D, revision 11): one tile of a radar picture, and the lattice the
// tiles sit on.
//
// The picture itself is the decoded wire object (PORTING §5) — `taken_min`, `south`, `west`,
// `zoom`, `product`, `coarse`, `partial`, `bounds`, `size`, `rows` — and `MeshWXRadar` is the
// namespace of functions over it. `rows` is `size` strings of the digits 0-3, north row first,
// west column first, exactly as the vectors print them.
//
// Two things here are worth naming rather than inlining wherever they are needed:
//
// - **The lattice.** Tiles sit on a lattice of half their span so that every phone can use a
//   tile any phone asked for: two people in the same town ask for the same square, and one
//   answer serves them both on a shared channel. The rounding is spelled out in integers and
//   `Math.floor(x / step + 0.5)` rather than a rounding function, because a tie has to fall the
//   same way in Python, Swift and JavaScript or the two clients ask for different tiles.
// - **Unknown is not dry.** A partial tile's cells outside `bounds` are level 0 on the wire,
//   because the wire has no fifth level, and they mean *the picture does not reach here*.
//   Everything that reads a cell goes through `MeshWXRadar.isKnown` or gets `null`.
