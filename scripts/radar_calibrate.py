"""Calibrate the EMWIN radar mosaics: where each picture sits on the earth, and
which of its pixels are map furniture.

    scripts/radar_calibrate.py SAMPLES_DIR [PRODUCT ...]

SAMPLES_DIR holds a few dozen `*-RAD*.GIF` per product, spread over two or
three days (any depth of sub-directories; the dish's own `emwin/YYYY-MM-DD/`
tree works as it is).  Writes `meshcore_weather/radar/products.json` and one
mask per product under `meshcore_weather/radar/masks/`.

Nothing here runs on the bot.  Run it again when the Weather Service changes
the pictures, which the bot notices by itself (`RadarPicture.frame_ok`).

How the frame is found.  The pictures carry no georeference, but they draw
state lines and coasts in black, in the same place every time.  Between the
banner and the legend, x is linear in longitude and y is linear in Mercator
latitude, so four numbers place a picture: its west, east, north and south
edges.  They are fitted by laying the bundled state outlines over the black
pixels and minimising the mean distance from an outline point to the nearest
black pixel.  A good fit is under one pixel.

How the furniture is found.  A pixel that is not background (white land, pale
blue water) in six pictures out of ten is a road, a border or a label, not
weather.  Those are masked, and the black ones among them are remembered too:
they are what `frame_ok` checks a new picture against.
